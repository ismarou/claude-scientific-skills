# Ethics Self-Assessment Checklist

## Overview

All Horizon Europe proposals must address ethical issues. This checklist helps identify potential ethics issues that require attention in your proposal and may require ethics review.

**Principle**: If you answer "Yes" to any question, you must address it in your proposal and may need to provide additional ethics documentation during project implementation.
