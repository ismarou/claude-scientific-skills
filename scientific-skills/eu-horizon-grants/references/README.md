# EU Horizon Europe Grant Writing: Quick-Start Guide

## Overview

This reference collection provides comprehensive guidance for writing competitive EU Horizon Europe research proposals. Whether you're preparing a collaborative RIA/IA project, an ERC frontier research grant, an MSCA fellowship, or an EIC innovation proposal, these resources will guide you through the process.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget (2021-2027) | ~EUR 95.5 billion |
| Typical Success Rate | 10-15% (varies by call) |
| Funding Rate (RIA) | 100% of eligible costs |
| Indirect Costs | 25% flat rate |
| Minimum Consortium (RIA/IA) | 3 entities from 3 countries |

## Which Reference Should I Use?

### Starting a New Proposal

1. **First**: Read `horizon_europe_overview.md` to understand the programme structure
2. **Then**: Based on your call type:
   - Collaborative project → `excellence_section.md`, `impact_section.md`, `implementation_section.md`
   - ERC grant → `erc_grants.md`
   - MSCA fellowship → `msca_grants.md`
   - EIC funding → `eic_grants.md`

### Specific Topics

| Writing Section 1: Excellence | `excellence_section.md` |
| Writing Section 2: Impact | `impact_section.md` |
| Writing Section 3: Implementation | `implementation_section.md` |
| Finding & managing partners | `consortium_building.md` |
| Budget preparation & cost rules | `budget_rules_exhaustive.md` |
| Open Access & Data Management | `open_science.md` |
| ERC Starting/Consolidator/Advanced | `erc_grants.md` |
| MSCA Postdoctoral/Doctoral Networks | `msca_grants.md` |
| EIC Pathfinder/Transition/Accelerator | `eic_grants.md` |

## Key Differences from US Grants

If you're familiar with NSF or NIH proposals, note these critical differences:

### Structure
- **US**: Specific Aims page + Research Strategy
- **EU**: Excellence + Impact + Implementation (three scored sections)

### Team Composition
- **US**: Single PI or small collaborative team
- **EU**: Multi-country consortium (minimum 3 organizations from 3 countries for most calls)

### Budget Model
- **US**: Negotiated institutional F&A rates (40-60%+)
- **EU**: Fixed 25% flat rate on eligible direct costs

### Open Science
- **US**: Data sharing encouraged, specific policies vary
- **EU**: **Mandatory** immediate Open Access for publications; FAIR data principles required

### Evaluation Style
- **US**: Panel + mail review, percentile scoring
- **EU**: Remote individual evaluation + consensus meeting, threshold-based scoring

### Resubmission
- **US**: Allowed with response to reviewers
- **EU**: Fresh submission required for each call (no formal resubmission mechanism)

## Success Metrics by Programme

### Horizon Europe Overall
- Success rate: ~15% average
- Competition varies significantly by topic and call

### ERC Grants
| Type | Typical Success Rate |
|------|---------------------|
| Starting Grant | 12-15% |
| Consolidator Grant | 12-15% |
| Advanced Grant | 10-12% |
| Synergy Grant | 8-10% |

### MSCA
| Type | Typical Success Rate |
|------|---------------------|
| Postdoctoral Fellowships | 12-15% |
| Doctoral Networks | 8-12% |

### EIC Accelerator
- Full proposal success: ~5-8%
- Highly competitive, interview stage critical

## Quick Tips for Success

### Do
- Start consortium building 6+ months before deadline
- Use exact call text language in your proposal
- Create visual impact pathway diagrams
- Address all evaluation criteria explicitly
- Get external review before submission
- Submit 48+ hours before deadline

### Don't
- Assume US grant experience translates directly
- Underestimate Open Science requirements
- Build consortium at last minute
- Ignore gender dimension in research content
- Submit without partner budget confirmation
- Wait until deadline (portal issues common)

## How to Use These References

### For Writing a Proposal
1. Start with the appropriate Part B template from `../assets/`
2. Read the relevant section guides (`excellence_section.md`, etc.)
3. Use `consortium_building.md` for partner coordination
4. Consult `budget_rules_exhaustive.md` for cost planning
5. Check `open_science.md` for compliance requirements

### For Specific Grant Types
- **Collaborative RIA/IA**: Use all three section guides
- **ERC**: Focus on `erc_grants.md` (different structure)
- **MSCA-PF**: Focus on `msca_grants.md` (individual fellowship)
- **EIC**: Focus on `eic_grants.md` (business plan emphasis)

### Templates Available
Check the `../assets/` folder for:
- Part B templates (RIA/IA, ERC, MSCA)
- Work package structure template
- Gantt chart template
- Budget justification template
- Ethics self-assessment checklist
