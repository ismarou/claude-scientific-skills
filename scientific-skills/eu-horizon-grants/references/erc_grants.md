# ERC Grants: Comprehensive Guide to European Research Council Funding

## Overview

The European Research Council (ERC) funds frontier research based purely on scientific excellence. Unlike collaborative Horizon Europe projects, ERC grants support individual Principal Investigators (PIs) pursuing groundbreaking, high-risk/high-gain research across all fields.

**Key Principle**: Excellence is the sole evaluation criterion. There are no thematic priorities—any research topic can be funded if sufficiently excellent.

**Budget**: ~EUR 16 billion for Horizon Europe (2021-2027)

| C | Not competitive |

### Two-Step Process (StG, CoG, AdG)

**Step 1: Extended Synopsis (B1)**
- 5 pages
- Evaluated by panel
- ~25% advance to Step 2

**Step 2: Full Proposal (B2)**
- 15 pages
- Detailed evaluation
- Panel interview for shortlisted

**Synergy Grants**: Single-stage with additional requirements

### Interview (If Shortlisted)

**Format**:
- PI presents (typically 5-10 minutes)
- Panel Q&A (20-30 minutes)
- Virtual or in-person (Brussels)

**Preparation**:
- Know proposal inside out

**ERC funds transformative research**:
- Not incremental progress
- Not routine applications of methods
- Must change how we think/understand/do

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the breakthrough?
- Why is this important?
- Why now? Why you?
- What will change if successful?

### Demonstrating Excellence

**Research Excellence**:
- Novel concepts or approaches
- Challenges existing paradigms
- Significant scientific impact potential

**PI Excellence**:
- Track record appropriate to career stage
- Independence and leadership
- Intellectual capacity demonstrated

### Common Weaknesses

**Research Project**:
- Incremental rather than groundbreaking
- Methodology not innovative
- Objectives not ambitious enough
- Too broad or too narrow focus

**Principal Investigator**:
- Track record doesn't match proposal
- Independence not demonstrated
- Publications not in relevant area
- Missing key expertise

### Groundbreaking Nature

**What Makes Research Groundbreaking**:
- Opens new research directions
- Challenges established paradigms
- Creates new methodologies
- Provides transformative solutions

**How to Demonstrate**:
- Position against current state of art
- Explain paradigm shift
- Show what was impossible before
- Articulate scientific vision

## Budget Considerations

### ERC Budget Model

**100% funding** of eligible costs plus **25% indirect costs**

**Typical Budget Categories**:
- Personnel (typically 60-70%)
- Equipment (typically 10-20%)
- Travel and consumables
- Other direct costs

### Personnel

**PI Effort**:
- Minimum 50% working time on ERC project
- If >50%, can include PI salary proportionally
- If academic with 100% salary covered, no claim

**Team Members**:
- Postdocs
- PhD students
- Research assistants
- Technicians

### Additional Funding (1M supplement)

**Justifiable When**:
- Exceptional equipment needs
- Expensive consumables (e.g., sequencing)
- Access to special facilities
- Large team requirements

**Must Be Justified** in proposal.

### Budget Flexibility

**ERC Principle**: PI autonomy in budget use

- Substantial flexibility during project
- Transfer between categories allowed
- Rebudgeting without prior approval (within limits)
- Focus on scientific outcomes, not financial micromanagement
