# Excellence Section: Writing Section 1 of Horizon Europe Proposals

## Overview

Section 1 (Excellence) typically carries the highest weight in Horizon Europe evaluations (often 50%). This section must convince evaluators that your project addresses an important problem with an ambitious yet feasible approach that advances beyond the current state of the art.

**Evaluation Question**: "To what extent is the proposed work ambitious, has innovation potential, and is beyond the state of the art?"

**Threshold**: 4 out of 5 (must be exceeded to be fundable)

## 1.1 Objectives and Ambition

### State of the Art

**Purpose**: Demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of the field and identify gaps your project addresses.

**What to Include**:
- Current scientific/technological landscape
- Key recent advances (cite recent literature, 3-5 years)
- Limitations of existing approaches
- Gaps in knowledge or capability
- Why current solutions are insufficient

**Writing Strategy**:

```
Good Structure:
1. Broad context (2-3 sentences)
2. Current best approaches (1 paragraph)
3. Limitations and gaps (1 paragraph)
4. Opportunity your project addresses (transition to objectives)
```

**Do**:
- Use recent references (past 5 years, seminal works older)
- Include your own prior work where relevant
- Show comprehensive field knowledge
- Be critical of current limitations
- Use specific examples and evidence

**Don't**:
- Write a literature review (be selective)
- Claim nothing has been done (reviewers know the field)
- Ignore competitors or alternative approaches
- Be vague about what's missing

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
**Current approaches to [topic]** rely primarily on [method/approach].
Recent advances by [Author, Year] and [Author, Year] have demonstrated
[specific achievements]. However, these approaches are limited by:
- [Limitation 1 with evidence]
- [Limitation 2 with evidence]
- [Limitation 3 with evidence]

**The critical gap** addressed by [ACRONYM] is [specific gap]. No existing
approach can [capability needed] because [technical reason].
```

### Objectives

**Purpose**: State what the project will achieve in clear, measurable terms.

**SMART Criteria**:
- **S**pecific: Clear, unambiguous targets
- **M**easurable: Quantifiable success indicators
- **A**chievable: Realistic within project resources
- **R**elevant: Aligned with call expected outcomes
- **T**ime-bound: Scheduled within project timeline

**Structure Options**:

**Option 1: Numbered Objectives**
```markdown
The overall objective of [ACRONYM] is to [high-level goal].

**Specific objectives:**
1. **[O1]**: [Action verb] [specific target] [measurable outcome]
2. **[O2]**: [Action verb] [specific target] [measurable outcome]
3. **[O3]**: [Action verb] [specific target] [measurable outcome]
```

**Option 2: Research Questions**
```markdown
[ACRONYM] addresses the following research questions:
- **RQ1**: [Question formulation]?
- **RQ2**: [Question formulation]?

```

**Strong Action Verbs for Objectives**:
- Develop, Design, Demonstrate
- Validate, Verify, Characterize
- Quantify, Model, Predict
- Synthesize, Integrate, Optimize
- Deploy, Implement, Scale

**Weak Verbs to Avoid**:
- Study, Investigate, Explore (too vague)
- Try, Attempt, Aim (lack confidence)
- Understand, Learn (not measurable)

**Mapping to Call Text**:
Always explicitly link objectives to call expected outcomes:

```markdown
| Project Objective | Call Expected Outcome |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| O1: Develop... | "Projects should develop..." |
| O2: Validate... | "Validation in relevant environments..." |
| O3: Demonstrate... | "Demonstration at scale..." |
```

### Ambition and Beyond State of the Art

**Purpose**: Convince evaluators that success would represent significant advancement.

**What "Beyond State of the Art" Means**:
- **Not**: Incremental improvement on existing methods
- **Yes**: Novel capabilities, approaches, or understanding
- **Yes**: First demonstration of [X]
- **Yes**: Order of magnitude improvement in [metric]
- **Yes**: New combination of previously separate approaches

**How to Articulate Ambition**:

1. **Explicit Novelty Claims**
```markdown
[ACRONYM] will be the **first** to:
- [Novel achievement 1]
- [Novel achievement 2]
- [Novel achievement 3]
```

2. **Quantified Improvements**
```markdown
Current best performance: [X metric]
[ACRONYM] target: [Y metric] = [Z]x improvement
```

3. **Paradigm Shift Description**
```markdown
While current approaches [limitation], [ACRONYM] introduces a
fundamentally new approach based on [innovation] that will
enable [new capability].
```

**Evidence for Feasibility**:
- Preliminary results
- Proof-of-concept demonstrations
- Published work supporting approach
- Team track record

**Balance Ambition and Feasibility**:
- Be ambitious but realistic
- Provide evidence ambition is achievable
- Include risk mitigation (brief mention, details in methodology)

## 1.2 Methodology

### Overall Methodology

**Purpose**: Describe HOW you will achieve the objectives with sufficient detail to judge feasibility.

**Key Elements**:
1. Overall research/innovation approach
2. Work package structure overview
3. Logical flow and dependencies
4. Integration of different approaches
5. Decision points and contingencies

**Methodology Diagram**:
Include a figure showing:
- Work package relationships
- Data/information flows
- Key decision points
- Timeline overview

```
Figure 1: [ACRONYM] methodology overview showing the relationship
between work packages and information flows.
```

### Research Methods and Approaches

**Detail Level**: Enough for expert reviewers to assess feasibility, not a full protocol.

**For Each Major Method**:
- Brief description of approach
- Justification for choice
- Expected outcomes
- Validation strategy
- Alternatives if primary approach fails

**Structure by Work Package or Objective**:

```markdown
**Approach to Objective 1: [Title]**

*Method*: We will employ [method/technique] to [purpose]. This approach
was selected because [justification] and has been validated by [evidence].

*Implementation*: [Brief description of how method will be applied]

*Validation*: Results will be validated through [validation approach].

*Alternative approach*: If [risk], we will [contingency].
```

**Technology Readiness Levels**:

| TRL | Definition | Evidence Required |
|-----|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Basic principles observed | Scientific literature |
| 2 | Technology concept formulated | Patent, publication |
| 3 | Experimental proof of concept | Lab demonstration |
| 4 | Technology validated in lab | Prototype testing |
| 5 | Technology validated in relevant environment | Pilot results |
| 6 | Technology demonstrated in relevant environment | Prototype performance |
| 7 | System prototype demonstration in operational environment | System testing |
| 8 | System complete and qualified | Pre-production testing |
| 9 | Actual system proven in operational environment | Market deployment |

**TRL Progression Statement**:
```markdown
[ACRONYM] will advance [technology/approach] from TRL [X] to TRL [Y].

| Component | Starting TRL | Target TRL | Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| [Component 1] | [X] | [Y] | [Evidence for starting TRL] |
| [Component 2] | [X] | [Y] | [Evidence for starting TRL] |
```

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Register Format**:

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| R1 | [Technical risk] | Medium | High | [Mitigation approach] |
| R2 | [Resource risk] | Low | Medium | [Mitigation approach] |
| R3 | [External risk] | Low | High | [Mitigation approach] |

**Risk Categories**:
- **Technical**: Method failure, performance shortfall
- **Resource**: Personnel availability, equipment access
- **External**: Regulatory changes, stakeholder cooperation
- **Timeline**: Delays, dependencies
- **Consortium**: Partner withdrawal, communication

**Probability Definitions**:
- **Low**: <20% chance of occurring
- **Medium**: 20-50% chance
- **High**: >50% chance

**Impact Definitions**:
- **Low**: Minor delay or workaround needed
- **Medium**: Significant replanning required
- **High**: Project objectives at risk

### Interdisciplinary Aspects

**When Required**: Most Horizon Europe calls value interdisciplinarity.

**How to Address**:

```markdown
**Interdisciplinary approach**

[ACRONYM] integrates expertise from [Discipline 1], [Discipline 2], and
[Discipline 3] to address [challenge] that cannot be solved by any
single discipline.

| Discipline | Contribution | Integration Point |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Discipline 1] | [Specific expertise] | WP[X] → WP[Y] |
| [Discipline 2] | [Specific expertise] | WP[X] → WP[Z] |

**Knowledge integration mechanisms**:
- Cross-WP workshops (Month X, Y, Z)
- Joint deliverables (D[X], D[Y])
- Secondments between partners
```

### Gender Dimension in Research Content

**Important**: This is about research content, NOT team gender balance.

**When Applicable**:
- Human subjects research
- Health and medicine
- Social sciences
- Technology with human users
- Climate/environment with social dimensions

**How to Address**:

```markdown
**Sex and gender analysis**

[ACRONYM] integrates sex and gender analysis in the following ways:
- [Specific approach 1]: [How sex/gender variables are considered]
- [Specific approach 2]: [How results will be disaggregated]
- [Specific approach 3]: [How gendered implications are assessed]
```

**If Not Applicable**:
```markdown
**Sex and gender analysis**

The research content of [ACRONYM] does not involve sex or gender
dimensions because [specific justification - e.g., fundamental physics,
materials without human application].
```

### Open Science Practices

**Mandatory Commitment**:
- Open Access to publications (immediate, no embargo)
- FAIR data management
- Open methodologies where appropriate

**How to Address**:

```markdown
**Open science practices**

[ACRONYM] is committed to Open Science through:

**Publications**: All peer-reviewed publications will be made Open
Access immediately upon publication through [repository/route].

**Data**: Research data will be managed according to FAIR principles
and shared through [repository] under [license].

**Methods and software**: [Open approaches to methodologies]

**Early sharing**: [Preprints, open protocols, etc.]
```

### Research Data Management

**Brief Statement** (detailed DMP is separate deliverable):

```markdown
**Research data management**

[ACRONYM] will generate the following types of data:
- [Data type 1]: [Format, estimated volume, sensitivity]
- [Data type 2]: [Format, estimated volume, sensitivity]

Data management will follow the FAIR principles. A detailed Data
Management Plan (D[X]) will be submitted by Month 6 and updated
throughout the project. Data will be deposited in [repository].

[ACRONYM] follows "as open as possible, as closed as necessary"
with appropriate protection for [any restricted data].
```

## Writing Tips for Excellence

### First Paragraph Hook
Start with a compelling statement about why this matters:

```markdown
❌ "This project will study X using method Y."

✓ "[Challenge] affects [stakeholders] by [impact]. Current approaches
cannot [limitation]. [ACRONYM] will [solution] by [innovation]."
```

### Bold Key Points
Help skimming evaluators find key messages:

```markdown
Current methods achieve **only 50% accuracy**. [ACRONYM] will deliver
**>90% accuracy** through **novel AI-based approach** validated by
**preliminary results showing 85% accuracy** on benchmark datasets.
```

### Use Structure
Clear headings, numbered lists, tables:

```markdown
**Key innovations of [ACRONYM]:**
1. **[Innovation 1]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Innovation 2]**: [Brief description]
3. **[Innovation 3]**: [Brief description]
```

### Reference Call Text
Mirror call language in your proposal:

```markdown
Call: "Projects should develop novel approaches to..."
Proposal: "[ACRONYM] develops novel approaches to [X] through [Y]..."
```

### Show Confidence
Avoid hedging language:

```markdown
❌ "We hope to achieve..."
❌ "We will try to..."
❌ "This might result in..."

✓ "We will achieve..."
✓ "[ACRONYM] delivers..."
✓ "This results in..."
```
