# EIC Grants: European Innovation Council Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The European Innovation Council (EIC) supports breakthrough innovation from early research to market deployment. Unlike other Horizon Europe programmes, EIC specifically targets high-risk, high-reward innovations with potential for significant market and societal impact.

**Key Principle**: Support visionary innovators and technologies too risky for private investment alone.

**Budget**: ~EUR 10.1 billion for Horizon Europe (2021-2027)
