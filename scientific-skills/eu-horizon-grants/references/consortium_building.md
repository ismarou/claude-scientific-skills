# Consortium Building: Partnerships for Horizon Europe

## Overview

Building an effective consortium is one of the most critical—and time-consuming—aspects of Horizon Europe proposal preparation. The right partnership can determine success; the wrong one guarantees failure. Start early and invest significant effort in partner selection.

**Key Principle**: The consortium should be the minimum necessary team with complementary expertise to achieve the objectives. More partners does not mean a better proposal.

## Evaluating Potential Partners

### Essential Criteria

**1. Expertise Match**
- Does their expertise fill a specific gap?
- Track record in the required area?
- Publications, patents, previous projects?

**2. Reliability**
- Financial stability?
- History of successful project participation?
- Reputation in the community?

**3. Commitment**
- Willing to invest time in proposal?
- Available resources for execution?
- Institutional support?

**4. Complementarity**
- Do they bring unique value?
- No overlap with other partners?
- Appropriate scale for the role?

### Red Flags

**Avoid partners who:**
- Want to join without contributing to proposal writing
- Cannot explain their specific contribution
- Have history of project failures
- Request disproportionate budget for their role
- Cannot commit key personnel
- Have conflict of interest with other partners
- Only want involvement for prestige/EU funding access

### Due Diligence Checklist

- [ ] Verify organization registration (legal entity)
- [ ] Check financial standing (annual reports if available)
- [ ] Review previous EU project participation (CORDIS)
- [ ] Confirm key personnel availability
- [ ] Check for conflicts with other consortium members
- [ ] Verify SME status if claimed
- [ ] Assess English language capability
- [ ] Evaluate responsiveness and communication

## Building the Consortium

### Ideal Consortium Characteristics

**Complementary Expertise**
- Each partner has distinct, necessary role
- No significant gaps in required expertise
- No unnecessary duplication

**Balanced Composition**
- Mix of academia, research organizations, industry
- Geographic spread across EU/AC
- Large organizations balanced with SMEs

**Track Record**
- Prior collaboration experience (even informal)
- Successful project history
- Key personnel with relevant achievements

**Manageable Size**
- Large enough to cover all needs
- Small enough for effective coordination
- Typically 5-10 partners for EUR 3-5M projects

### Consortium Size Guidelines

| Project Budget | Typical Partners | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| EUR 1-2M | 3-5 | Small, focused team |
| EUR 3-5M | 5-8 | Medium complexity |
| EUR 5-10M | 8-12 | Large coordination effort |
| EUR 10M+ | 10-15+ | Major initiatives only |

**Rule of thumb**: Average EUR 300-500K per partner over project duration.

### Sectoral Balance

**Typical RIA Composition**:
- 2-3 Universities/Research organizations (fundamental research)
- 1-2 RTOs (applied research, prototyping)
- 2-3 Industry/SMEs (exploitation, market perspective)
- 0-1 Public bodies/NGOs (policy, end-user)

**Typical IA Composition**:
- 1-2 Universities/Research organizations (research support)
- 1-2 RTOs (technology development)
- 3-5 Industry/SMEs (innovation focus)
- 1-2 End-users (validation, adoption)

| Budget disputes | Transparent initial allocation | Refer to CA procedures |
| IP conflicts | Clear CA provisions | Mediation per CA |
| Communication breakdown | Regular meetings, clear channels | Coordinator intervention |
| Partner withdrawal | Robust CA provisions | Replacement procedure |

### Conflict Resolution

**Escalation Path**:
1. Direct discussion between parties
2. WP Leader mediation
3. Coordinator intervention
4. Steering Committee decision
5. General Assembly (for major disputes)
6. External mediation/arbitration (per CA)

## Budget Negotiation

### Budget Allocation Principles

**Effort-based**: Budget follows person-months and activities
**Fair**: Proportionate to contribution
**Transparent**: All partners see full budget
**Justified**: Every cost linked to activities

### Common Budget Issues

| Issue | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Everyone wants more | Link budget strictly to activities |
| Coordinator wants disproportionate share | Benchmark against similar projects |
| SMEs have higher rates | Explain eligibility rules |
| Disagreement on equipment | Clarify who needs/uses it |
| Subcontracting disputes | Limit to truly external tasks |

### Budget Discussion Checklist

- [ ] Person-month rates agreed (or ranges)
- [ ] Equipment purchases assigned
- [ ] Travel budget distributed
- [ ] Subcontracting identified and assigned
- [ ] Coordinator premium agreed
- [ ] Total within call budget limits
- [ ] Partner contributions proportionate to roles
