# Budget Rules: Comprehensive Guide to EU Cost Eligibility

## Overview

This reference provides exhaustive coverage of EU Horizon Europe cost eligibility rules based on the Annotated Model Grant Agreement (AGA). Understanding these rules is essential for preparing compliant budgets and avoiding financial problems during project execution.

**Key Principle**: Only eligible costs can be reimbursed. Ineligible costs, even if incurred for project activities, will not be funded.

**Source**: Annotated Model Grant Agreement (AGA) - Article 6

## The EU Funding Model

### Basic Formula

```
EU Contribution = (Eligible Direct Costs + Indirect Costs) × Funding Rate
```

Where:
- **Eligible Direct Costs** = Personnel + Subcontracting + Purchase Costs + Other
- **Indirect Costs** = 25% flat rate (with some exclusions)
- **Funding Rate** = 100% (RIA) or 70% (IA for-profit) or other

### Funding Rates by Action Type

| Action Type | For-Profit Entities | Non-Profit Entities |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| RIA (Research & Innovation) | 100% | 100% |
| IA (Innovation Action) | 70% | 100% |
| CSA (Coordination & Support) | 100% | 100% |
| ERC Grants | 100% | 100% |
| MSCA | Unit costs | Unit costs |
| EIC Accelerator | 70% (grant portion) | N/A |

### Non-Profit Definition

For 100% IA funding, entity must be:
- Research organization, or
- SME, or
- Legal entity with statutory non-profit objectives

---

## General Eligibility Conditions

### All Costs Must Be:

1. **Actually incurred** by the beneficiary
2. **Incurred during the action duration** (with limited exceptions)
3. **Indicated in the estimated budget** (Annex 2 of Grant Agreement)
4. **Incurred in connection with the action** and necessary for implementation
5. **Identifiable and verifiable** (recorded, documented, backed by originals)
6. **Compliant with applicable laws** (national tax, social legislation)
7. **Reasonable, justified, and compliant** with sound financial management

### Ineligible Costs

The following costs are **never eligible**:
- Identifiable indirect taxes (including recoverable VAT)
- Duties owed
- Interest owed
- Provisions for future losses or debts
- Exchange losses
- Costs of return on capital
- Costs incurred during suspension
- Costs reimbursed from other EU grants
- Excessive or reckless expenditure
- Costs for results not meeting expected TRL/maturity

---

## A. Personnel Costs

### Eligible Personnel Categories

1. **Employees** - direct employment contract
2. **Natural persons under direct contract** - service contracts
3. **Seconded persons** - formal secondment agreement
4. **SME owners** - without salary but working on action
5. **Natural persons without salary** - beneficiaries who are individuals

### Calculation Methods

#### Method 1: Actual Costs (Standard)

**Daily Rate Calculation**:
```
Daily personnel cost = Annual personnel cost ÷ 215 days

Where:
Annual personnel cost = Gross salary + Social charges + Other statutory costs
215 = Standard annual productive days for EU projects
```

**Monthly Approximation**:
```
Monthly productive days = 215 ÷ 12 = 17.92 days/month
```

**Eligible Personnel Costs**:
```
Personnel costs = Daily rate × Days worked on action
```

**Annual Personnel Costs Include**:
- Gross salary
- Employer social security contributions
- Pension contributions
- Health insurance (employer portion)
- Mandatory insurances
- Taxes linked to remuneration
- Bonus/variable pay if part of standard practices

**Annual Personnel Costs Exclude**:
- Overtime (unless standard practice, documented)
- Redundancy payments
- Non-salary benefits in kind
- Travel costs (separate category)

#### Method 2: Unit Costs (Specific Actions)

For MSCA and some specific calls:
```
Personnel costs = Person-months × Unit cost rate
```

Unit costs include salary, mobility allowance, and sometimes research costs.

### Time Recording Requirements

**Mandatory for all personnel costs**:
- Timesheets or equivalent time-tracking
- Record actual hours/days worked on action
- Distinguish between different EU projects
- Signed by employee and supervisor
- Contemporaneous recording (not retrospective)

**Minimum Timesheet Content**:
- Employee name
- Action reference (project name/number)
- Date
- Hours/days worked on action
- Description of tasks performed
- Signature (employee)
- Verification (supervisor)

### SME Owner Compensation

**For SME owners without salary**:
```
Eligible costs = Unit cost × Hours worked on action

Unit cost = Latest documented annual salary ÷ 1720 hours
OR
National equivalent for comparable work
```

**Requirements**:
- Time tracking required
- No double compensation (not also claiming salary)
- Documentation of equivalent salary

### Personnel Cost Examples

**Example 1: Researcher with EUR 60,000 annual cost**
```
Daily rate = 60,000 ÷ 215 = EUR 279.07/day
If works 50 days on project = EUR 13,953.50
```

**Example 2: Part-time dedication (50%)**
```
Annual dedication = 215 × 50% = 107.5 days
Maximum claimable = 107.5 days at daily rate
```

**Example 3: Joined mid-project**
```
If joins M7 of 36-month project:
Available months = 30 months
Pro-rata calculation required
```

## B. Subcontracting

### Definition

Subcontracting = specific tasks of the action performed by third parties (subcontractors) on behalf of the beneficiary.

### When Subcontracting is Allowed

- Tasks that cannot be performed by beneficiaries
- Specific, limited tasks identified in proposal
- Best value for money demonstrated
- No major part of action subcontracted

### Rules for Subcontracting

1. **Pre-approval**: Must be identified in proposal and Annex 1
2. **Best value for money**: Fair procurement process
3. **No conflict of interest**: Independent selection
4. **Consortium exclusion**: Beneficiaries cannot be subcontractors
5. **Clear contract**: Written agreement with subcontractor

### Procurement Requirements

**Below EUR 60,000**: Direct award with justification
**EUR 60,000 - Directive thresholds**: At least 3 quotations
**Above Directive thresholds**: Full procurement procedure

### What is NOT Subcontracting

- Purchase of goods (equipment, materials)
- Travel and subsistence services
- Minor services (translation, editing)
- Affiliated entities performing tasks
- Beneficiaries performing tasks

### Subcontracting Budget

- Listed separately in budget
- Justified in Part B
- Subject to 100% reimbursement (within funding rate)
- No indirect costs on subcontracting
- Typically limited to <30% of total budget (informal guideline)

---

## C. Purchase Costs

### C.1 Travel and Subsistence

**Eligible Costs**:
- Transportation (economy class for air)
- Accommodation
- Meals
- Visas

**EU Daily Allowance Rates** (if using EU rates):
- Published by EC
- Vary by destination country
- Cover accommodation + meals

### C.2 Equipment

**Definition**: Durable goods (> EUR 5,000 typically) used for the action.

**Depreciation Rules**:
```
Eligible cost = Purchase price × (% use for action) × (Project duration ÷ Useful life)
```

**Example**:
```
Equipment: EUR 50,000
Use on project: 80%
Project duration: 3 years
Useful life: 5 years

Eligible = 50,000 × 0.80 × (3÷5) = EUR 24,000
```

**Full Cost Eligibility** (no depreciation) when:
- Equipment specifically purchased for action
- Fully used up during action
- Or written off according to usual practices

**Documentation Required**:
- Purchase invoice
- Proof of delivery and payment

## I. Budget Preparation Guidelines

### Budget Form Structure

The standard Horizon Europe budget follows this structure:

| Category | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| A.1 | Personnel costs | Person-months × daily rate |
| A.2 | Subcontracting | Identified tasks |
| A.3 | Purchase costs | Travel, equipment, goods/services |
| A.4 | Other cost categories | Cascade funding, etc. |
| B | Indirect costs | 25% flat rate |
| **Total** | | A + B |

### Budget Justification

For each significant cost item, explain:
- What: Description of cost
- Why: Necessity for project objectives
- Who: Which partner incurs the cost
- When: Timing during project
- How much: Cost calculation basis

### Common Budget Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Underestimating coordination | Coordinator underfunded | Add 5-10% for management |
| Forgetting travel | No budget for meetings | Plan all project meetings |
| Incorrect indirect base | Over/under calculation | Apply exclusions correctly |
| Missing audit costs | Surprise expenses | Include CFS if >325K |
| Unrealistic personnel rates | Budget shortfall | Use actual organizational rates |
| Equipment depreciation error | Ineligible overclaim | Calculate depreciation properly |

### Sample Budget Breakdown (EUR 3M RIA)

| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Personnel | EUR 1,800,000 | 60% |
| Equipment | EUR 150,000 | 5% |
| Travel | EUR 180,000 | 6% |
| Other direct | EUR 150,000 | 5% |
| Subcontracting | EUR 120,000 | 4% |
| Indirect (25%) | EUR 600,000 | 20% |
| **Total** | **EUR 3,000,000** | **100%** |

## J. Country-Specific Considerations

### Personnel Cost Variations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Salary levels | Vary significantly across EU |
| Social charges | Range from 20% to 50%+ of gross |
| Taxation | Different employer obligations |
| Working hours | Legal working time varies |
| Academic calendars | Teaching vs. research time |

### Procurement Rules

National procurement laws apply above certain thresholds:
- Germany: VOL/VOB
- France: Code de la Commande Publique
- UK: Public Contracts Regulations
- Others: National transposition of EU Directives

### VAT Treatment

- VAT recoverable by beneficiary: Not eligible
- VAT non-recoverable: Eligible (treated as part of cost)
- VAT status varies by entity type and country
