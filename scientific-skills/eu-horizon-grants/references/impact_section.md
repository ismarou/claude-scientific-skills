# Impact Section: Writing Section 2 of Horizon Europe Proposals

## Overview

Section 2 (Impact) typically carries significant weight in Horizon Europe evaluations (often 30%). This section must demonstrate how project results will lead to meaningful change—scientific, economic, societal, or policy-related—and how you will maximize the reach and uptake of your outputs.

**Evaluation Question**: "To what extent does the project demonstrate credible pathways to achieving expected impacts, with convincing measures to maximize impact?"

**Threshold**: 4 out of 5 (must be exceeded to be fundable)

## Understanding the Impact Hierarchy

### Three Levels of Change

| Level | Definition | Timeframe | Control |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Results/Outputs** | Direct products of project activities | During project | Full control |
| **Outcomes** | Changes from use of results | 2-5 years post-project | Partial influence |
| **Impacts** | Broader societal/economic change | 5-10+ years | Contributing factor |

### Illustrative Examples

**Research Project Example**:
- **Result**: New AI algorithm for disease diagnosis
- **Outcome**: Clinical adoption by 50 hospitals
- **Impact**: 20% reduction in late-stage cancer diagnoses

**Innovation Project Example**:
- **Result**: Validated prototype of green manufacturing process
- **Outcome**: Licensing to 10 manufacturing companies
- **Impact**: 5% reduction in sector carbon emissions

## 2.1 Project's Pathways Towards Impact

### The Impact Pathway Diagram

**Mandatory or Strongly Recommended** in most Horizon Europe calls.

**Structure**:
```
Activities → Results/Outputs → Outcomes → Impacts
     ↑                              ↓
     └── Target Groups and Measures ←┘
```

**Visual Requirements**:
- Clear arrows showing causal chain
- Target groups/stakeholders identified
- Measures for each transition
- Quantified where possible

**Example Impact Pathway**:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ WP2: Method │    │ Validated   │    │ Industry    │    │ 30% energy  │
│ Development │───→│ technology  │───→│ adoption by │───→│ savings in  │
│             │    │ (TRL 6)     │    │ 2028        │    │ sector      │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
                         │                   │
                         ▼                   ▼
                   Dissemination       Exploitation
                   to research         via licensing
                   community           agreements
```

### Linking to Call Expected Impacts

**Critical**: Directly reference call text expected impacts.

**Call Text Example**:
> "Projects are expected to contribute to:
> - Reduced greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector
> - New market opportunities for European SMEs"

**Proposal Response**:
```markdown
**Contribution to Call Expected Impacts**

| Call Expected Impact | [ACRONYM] Contribution | Evidence/KPI |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Reduced GHG emissions from buildings | 15% reduction in heating energy demand through [technology] | Validated in WP4 pilots |
| Market opportunities for SMEs | 3 SME consortium partners to commercialize results | Exploitation plans in WP6 |
```

### Expected Outcomes

**Definition**: Changes resulting from stakeholders using/adopting project results.

**How to Write Outcomes**:

```markdown
**Expected Outcomes**

By [timeframe], [ACRONYM] will deliver outcomes including:

## Common Mistakes in Impact Section

### Impact Pathway
- **Missing diagram**: Just text description
- **Vague outcomes**: "Results will be used"
- **Unrealistic claims**: Overpromising impact
- **No causal logic**: Gaps in the chain

### Dissemination/Exploitation
- **Generic plans**: Not specific to project outputs
- **Missing targets**: No quantification
- **Unclear responsibilities**: Who does what?
- **Unrealistic timeline**: Activities before results exist

### IP Management
- **Ignored**: No mention of IP
- **Conflicting statements**: Different approaches across sections
- **Over-protection**: Everything patented, limits uptake
- **Under-protection**: No strategy for valuable IP

### KPIs
- **Output focus only**: Only counting publications
- **No baseline**: Can't measure change
- **Unattributable**: Can't link to project
- **Too ambitious**: Unrealistic targets

## Writing Tips for Impact

### Link to Call Text Explicitly

```markdown
Call: "Projects should contribute to the European Green Deal target
of climate neutrality by 2050."

Proposal: "[ACRONYM] directly contributes to the European Green Deal
climate neutrality target by enabling [X]% reduction in [sector]
emissions through [mechanism]."
```

### Quantify Everything Possible

```markdown
❌ "[ACRONYM] will have significant economic impact."

✓ "[ACRONYM] will generate EUR [X]M in economic value through:
- [Y] new jobs created
- [Z]% cost reduction for adopters
- EUR [W]M in licensing revenue"
```

### Use Tables for Clarity

Impact mapping tables help evaluators quickly see alignment:

```markdown
| Call Expected Impact | Project Contribution | KPI | Target |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----|--------|
| Climate neutrality | 15% emission reduction | CO2 saved | 1 Mt/year |
| Digital transformation | AI tool adoption | Users | 500 orgs |
| Job creation | Direct and indirect | Jobs | 1,000 |
```

### Balance Ambition with Credibility

- Provide evidence for claims
- Explain assumptions behind projections
- Acknowledge uncertainties
- Show calculation methodology

### Differentiate Outcomes and Impacts

```markdown
**Outcome (within influence)**:
50 manufacturing companies adopt the [ACRONYM] process by 2029.

**Impact (broader contribution)**:
The sector achieves 10% reduction in energy consumption, to which
[ACRONYM] contributes 3 percentage points through technology diffusion.
```
