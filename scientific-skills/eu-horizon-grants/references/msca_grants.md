# MSCA Grants: Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Guide

## Overview

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) support researcher training, career development, and mobility across borders and sectors. MSCA uses unit cost funding rather than actual costs, making budget planning straightforward but requiring careful attention to eligibility rules.

**Key Principle**: International mobility is central to all MSCA actions—researchers must move to new countries or sectors.

**Budget**: ~EUR 6.6 billion for Horizon Europe (2021-2027)

## Budget Planning

### Postdoctoral Fellowship Budget

**Automatic Calculation**:
```
Total = Duration (months) × (Living + Mobility + Family + Research + Management)
```

**Example (24-month European Fellowship)**:
```
Living: 24 × 5,080 = EUR 121,920
Mobility: 24 × 600 = EUR 14,400
Family (if applicable): 24 × 660 = EUR 15,840
Research/Training: 24 × 1,000 = EUR 24,000
Management: 24 × 650 = EUR 15,600

Total: EUR 191,760 (without family) or EUR 207,600 (with family)
```

### Doctoral Network Budget

**Per Doctoral Candidate (36 months)**:
```
Living: 36 × 3,400 = EUR 122,400
Mobility: 36 × 600 = EUR 21,600
Family (if applicable): 36 × 660 = EUR 23,760
Research/Training: 36 × 1,600 = EUR 57,600
Management: 36 × 1,200 = EUR 43,200

Per DC: EUR 245,200 (without family) or EUR 268,560 (with family)
